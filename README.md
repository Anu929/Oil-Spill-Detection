# 🌊 AI-Based Forecasting of Marine Oil Spill Trends (1970–2034)

This project uses machine learning and data visualization to predict the number of large marine oil spills globally using historical data from 1970 to 2023. It features a simple yet powerful dashboard built with Streamlit that allows users to forecast oil spill incidents for future years (2025–2034).
